    "Given an arbitrary collection of k-mers Patterns, we form a graph having a node for each k-mer in Patterns and connect k-mers Pattern and Pattern' by a directed edge if Suffix(Pattern) is equal to Prefix(Pattern'). The resulting graph is called the overlap graph on these k-mers, denoted Overlap(Patterns).\n",
