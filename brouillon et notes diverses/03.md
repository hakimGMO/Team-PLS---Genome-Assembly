def Overlap(Patterns):
    # Open the file and read all lines
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Remove spaces and newline characters
    kmers = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    # Check if there are any k-mers in the file
    if not kmers:
        return ""







To solve this problem, we need to generate an adjacency list for the overlap graph of a collection of k-mers. The adjacency list will have each k-mer as a node, with directed edges connecting nodes if the suffix of one k-mer matches the prefix of another.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def overlap_graph(kmers):
    # Dictionary to hold the adjacency list
    adjacency_list = {}

    # Iterate through each k-mer in the collection
    for pattern in kmers:
        suffix = pattern[1:]  # Suffix is the last k-1 characters

        # Check for overlap with other k-mers in the list
        for other_pattern in kmers:
            if pattern != other_pattern:
                prefix = other_pattern[:-1]  # Prefix is the first k-1 characters
                if suffix == prefix:
                    # Add the edge to the adjacency list
                    if pattern not in adjacency_list:
                        adjacency_list[pattern] = []
                    adjacency_list[pattern].append(other_pattern)
                    
    return adjacency_list

# Example usage
kmers = [
    "ATGCG",
    "GCATG",
    "CATGC",
    "AGGCA",
    "GGCAT"
]

# Construct the overlap graph
overlap_graph = overlap_graph(kmers)

# Print the adjacency list
for kmer, edges in overlap_graph.items():
    print(f"{kmer} -> {', '.join(edges)}")
```

### Explanation:
1. For each k-mer in the collection, we extract the suffix (last \(k-1\) characters).
2. We then check all other k-mers to see if any have a prefix (first \(k-1\) characters) that matches this suffix.
3. If there's a match, we add a directed edge from the first k-mer to the matching k-mer in our adjacency list.
  
This function returns an adjacency list representation of the overlap graph.
