# Find an Eulerian Path in a Graph
"""In “Find an Eulerian Cycle in a Graph”, we defined an Eulerian cycle. 
A path that traverses each edge of a graph exactly once (but does not necessarily return to its starting node is called an Eulerian path.

Eulerian Path Problem
Find an Eulerian path in a graph.

Given: A directed graph that contains an Eulerian path, where the graph is given in the form of an adjacency list.

Return: An Eulerian path in this graph."""
